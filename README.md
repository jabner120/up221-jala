I am Jala Ashan Abner, a second year MPP Candidate with an interest in economic mobility, stratification economics, and public finance. I attended Spelman College for my undergraduate education and studied Economics and Environmetal Studies. 

My interest in spatial data science and urban justice bloomed during my junior year of college when beginning my thesis on the Flint Water Crisis' impact on Home Valuation. Banzhaf and Walsh's article _Do People Vote with Their Feet? An Empirical Test of Tiebout_ also really piqued my interest in public finance and the movement of people towards public goods.

Within this course, I hope to enhance my coding and GIS abilities, as well as learn more about the amazing work being done within the realm of urban justice.
